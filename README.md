# Azure AI Landing Zone

## Overview

The Azure AI Landing Zone is an enterprise-scale, production-ready reference architecture designed to deploy secure and resilient AI applications and agents on Azure. This repository contains the Bicep implementation, the Terraform implementations are available in separate repositories.

## How to Deploy

Choose your preferred deployment method based on project requirements and environment constraints.

### Prerequisites

**Required Permissions:**

- Azure subscription with **Contributor** and **User Access Admin** roles
- Agreement to Responsible AI terms for Azure AI Services

**Required Tools:**

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> Azure CLI is included as a prerequisite for future pre/post provisioning hooks that may depend on it.

### Basic Deployment

Quick setup for demos without network isolation.

**Initialize the project**

```
azd init -t azure/bicep-ptn-aiml-landing-zone
```

**Sign in to Azure**

```
az login
azd auth login
```

> Add `--tenant` for `az` or `--tenant-id` for `azd` if you want a specific tenant.

**Provision Infrastructure**

```
azd provision
```
> **Optional:** You can change parameter values in `main.parameters.json` or set them using `azd env set` before running `azd provision`. The latter applies only to parameters that support environment variable substitution.

### Zero Trust Deployment

For deployments that **require network isolation**.

**Before Provisioning**

Enable network isolation in your environment:

```
azd env set NETWORK_ISOLATION true
```

> **Optional:** Update other parameters in `main.parameters.json` or via `azd env set` before provisioning.

Make sure you're signed in with your Azure user account:

```
az login
azd auth login
```

> Add `--tenant` for `az` or `--tenant-id` for `azd` if you want a specific tenant.

**Provision Infrastructure**

```
azd provision
```

**Using the Jumpbox VM**

1. **Reset the VM password** in the Azure Portal (required on first access if not set in deployment parameters):

   - Go to your VM resource → **Support + troubleshooting** → **Reset password** → Set new credentials
   - Default username is `testvmuser`

2. **Connect via Azure Bastion**

#### Cloning extra repositories onto the jumpbox

The default `install.ps1` bootstrap clones this repository to `C:\github\ai-lz` and walks `manifest.json#components` for additional repos. Downstream solution accelerators that consume this landing zone as a Bicep module / git submodule and need their own application repository present on the jumpbox (for private-network data-plane post-provisioning — Cosmos seeding, AI Search index creation, sample data loading, etc.) declare those repos in their **overlay** `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "tag": "v1.0.0",
  "ailz_tag": "v1.1.1",
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "voice-app",
      "repo": "https://github.com/Contoso/voice-app.git",
      "tag": "v0.3.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

`main.bicep` derives the URLs/tags/names from `_manifest.components` at compile time and forwards them to `install.ps1` over the CSE `commandToExecute`. Each entry is cloned into `C:\github\<name>` on the jumpbox. `tag` defaults to `main`; `name` defaults to the repo URL basename without `.git`. There are no per-deployment Bicep parameters to wire — `manifest.json` is the single source of truth, the same one consumers already use to pin their `ailz_tag` release.

#### Building and pushing images with network isolation

When `networkIsolation=true`, the Container Registry is deployed as **Premium** with `publicNetworkAccess=Disabled` and is only reachable via its private endpoint. `az acr build` against the shared Microsoft-managed builder will fail. This landing zone therefore provisions an **ACR Tasks agent pool** attached to the `devops-build-agents-subnet` so image builds run inside the VNet and push to the registry over its private endpoint. No Docker client is required (and the jumpbox has no Docker installed by design — see issue #14).

Build and push from the jumpbox (or any client that can reach ARM):

```powershell
$acr  = (azd env get-values | Select-String '^AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT').Line.Split('=')[1].Trim('"').Split('.')[0]
$pool = (azd env get-values | Select-String '^ACR_TASK_AGENT_POOL').Line.Split('=')[1].Trim('"')

az acr build `
  -r $acr `
  --agent-pool $pool `
  -t myapp:latest `
  -f Dockerfile `
  .
```

Pause billing between builds (default tier `S1` is billed per hour whether idle or not):

```powershell
az acr agentpool update -r <acr> -n <pool> --count 0
```

Resume before the next build:

```powershell
az acr agentpool update -r <acr> -n <pool> --count 1
```

The agent pool can be disabled entirely with `deployAcrTaskAgentPool=false` if builds are handled by a central CI/CD runner that already reaches the registry's private endpoint.

#### Firewall egress allow-list (network isolation)

When `networkIsolation=true`, egress from the jumpbox and workload subnets is forced through the default Azure Firewall. The landing zone codifies the FQDNs required by the default `install.ps1` bootstrap and by the ACR Tasks agent pool. The set is split by purpose so you can audit or trim it:

| Rule | Source subnet | FQDN group | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AllowMicrosoftContainerRegistry` | `*` | `mcr.microsoft.com`, `*.data.mcr.microsoft.com` | ACA/agents/ACR Tasks pulling Microsoft base images |
| `AllowEntraIdAuth` | `*` | `login.microsoftonline.com`, `login.windows.net`, `management.azure.com`, `graph.microsoft.com`, `*.applicationinsights.azure.com` | Entra ID auth, ARM control plane, App Insights telemetry |
| `AllowGitHub` | `*` | `github.com`, `*.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `codeload.github.com`, `objects.githubusercontent.com`, `*.githubusercontent.com` | Repo clones, release downloads |
| `AllowJumpboxBootstrap` | `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` | Chocolatey, NuGet, VS Installer, `download.microsoft.com`, `aka.ms`, `go.microsoft.com`, `*.core.windows.net`, `*.azureedge.net` | `choco install`, VS Code/PowerShell Core/Azure CLI/AZD MSIs (Python is installed from python.org embeddable zip — see `AllowJumpboxDevRuntimes`) |
| `AllowJumpboxDevRuntimes` | `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` | `*.python.org`, `*.pypi.org`, `*.pythonhosted.org`, `*.pypa.io`, `*.npmjs.org` | `pip install`, `npm install`, jumpbox Python embeddable-zip install + `get-pip.py` bootstrap |
| `AllowJumpboxEditors` | `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` | `update.code.visualstudio.com`, `*.vo.msecnd.net`, `*.vscode-cdn.net` | VS Code updates |
| `AllowJumpboxAcme` | `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` | `api.github.com`, `acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org` | win-acme release discovery + ACME v2 issuance/renewal from jumpbox |
| `AllowAcrTasks` | `devopsBuildAgentsSubnetPrefix` | `*.azurecr.io`, `*.data.azurecr.io` | ACR Tasks agent pool talking to its registry |

Set `extendFirewallForJumpboxBootstrap=false` to skip the jumpbox-scoped rules when egress is managed centrally by another policy.

### Permissions

The following role assignments are provisioned by the template based on the **default configuration** in `main.parameters.json`. This includes the default set of container apps, their associated roles, and the services they interact with. If you customize the parameters before provisioning — such as adding or removing container apps or changing role mappings — the actual assignments will vary accordingly.

### Optional Public Ingress (Application Gateway WAF v2)

**Issue #49.** The landing zone provisions the Container Apps environment in **internal** mode under network isolation, so its apps are unreachable from the public Internet by default. Some workloads need a controlled, audited public entry point (a tester, a partner integration, a public demo). The optional `publicIngress` feature deploys an **Application Gateway WAF v2** in front of the internal ACA environment without changing any of the existing internal topology.

> ⚠️ **Cost warning.** Enabling this feature deploys WAF_v2 + a Standard Public IP, which incur **hourly charges even when idle** (~USD 240/month for the gateway alone, region-dependent). Keep `publicIngress.enabled = false` unless actively needed and tear the stack down with `azd down` (or delete the resources manually) when the access window ends. **Setting `publicIngress.enabled` back to `false` after a deploy will NOT delete the resources** — `azd`/ARM incremental deployments only stop managing them.

**Default state:** disabled. No public-ingress resources are provisioned.

**Parameter contract** (`publicIngressType` exported from `main.bicep`):

```bicep
publicIngress: {
  enabled: bool                              // master toggle, default false
  backendAppIndex: int?                      // index into containerAppsList; default 0
  frontendHostName: string?                  // e.g., 'app.contoso.com' — required to activate HTTPS
  sslCertSecretId: string?                   // versionless Key Vault secret URI — required to activate HTTPS
  allowedSourceAddressPrefixes: string[]?    // CIDRs allowed to reach :443; empty list = deny-all
  wafMode: ('Prevention' | 'Detection')?     // default 'Prevention'
  wafCustomRules: object[]?                  // merged with OWASP CRS 3.2 managed ruleset
  capacity: object?                          // default { minCapacity: 0, maxCapacity: 2 }
  sslPolicy: object?                         // default Azure baseline
}
```

**Resources deployed when `enabled = true`** (only effective with `networkIsolation`, `deployContainerEnv`, and at least one entry in `containerAppsList`):

| Resource | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups` (`nsg-<vnet>-AppGatewaySubnet`) | Deny-all inbound except `GatewayManager` (65200-65535) and `AzureLoadBalancer`. Adds an `AllowHttpsFromAllowedSources` rule on TCP/443 only when `allowedSourceAddressPrefixes` is non-empty. **Port 80 is never opened from the Internet.** |
| `Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses` | Standard SKU, Static, zone-redundant when `useZoneRedundancy=true`. |
| `Microsoft.Network/ApplicationGatewayWebApplicationFirewallPolicies` | OWASP CRS 3.2, mode `Prevention` (or `Detection`), `wafCustomRules` merged in. |
| `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities` | Dedicated UAI for the gateway. |
| `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments` (`Key Vault Secrets User`) | Granted to the AGW UAI on the landing-zone Key Vault when `deployKeyVault=true`. External Key Vaults must be granted manually. |
| `Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways` | WAF_v2 SKU, autoscale 0..2, zone-redundant, attached to the existing `AppGatewaySubnet` (192.168.3.0/27). Backend pool targets the Container App's internal FQDN over HTTPS:443 with `pickHostNameFromBackendAddress=true`. |
| Diagnostic settings | Streamed to the existing Log Analytics workspace (`allLogs` + `AllMetrics`). |

**Two operational states:**

1. **Skeleton mode** (`enabled=true` and either `sslCertSecretId` or `frontendHostName` empty)
   - Gateway exists with a single HTTP:80 listener routed to the backend.
   - NSG denies all Internet inbound (port 80 is never opened by the NSG).
   - The skeleton is **inert**: no client can reach it from the Internet until the operator transitions to live mode.

2. **Live mode** (`enabled=true` with both `sslCertSecretId` and `frontendHostName` set, plus `allowedSourceAddressPrefixes` non-empty)
   - HTTPS:443 listener using the Key Vault certificate (the AGW UAI reads it via `Key Vault Secrets User`).
   - HTTP:80 becomes a permanent HTTP→HTTPS redirect.
   - NSG allows TCP/443 from the supplied source CIDRs only.

**Post-deploy runbook (provider-agnostic DNS + jumpbox ACME):**

1. **Workstation (DNS provider side):** choose your DNS provider/registrar and prepare your hostname (example: `app.contoso.com`). No provider-specific integration is required in this landing zone.
2. **Jumpbox (certificate issuance/import side):** use the built-in ACME client installed by `install.ps1` at `C:\tools\win-acme\wacs.exe` (DNS-01 flow), then import the resulting certificate into the landing-zone Key Vault. The jumpbox MI has `Key Vault Certificates Officer` for this workflow.
3. **Workstation (DNS provider side):** create/update the public DNS A record for the hostname pointing at `PUBLIC_INGRESS_PUBLIC_IP` (deployment output).
4. Capture the **versionless** Key Vault secret URI for the certificate (`https://<kv>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<name>`), then set operator parameters in `main.parameters.json` (or via `azd env set` followed by an edit since `publicIngress` is an aggregate object):
   ```jsonc
   "publicIngress": {
      "value": {
       "enabled": true,
       "frontendHostName": "app.contoso.com",
       "sslCertSecretId": "https://<kv>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<name>",
        "allowedSourceAddressPrefixes": ["203.0.113.0/24"]
      }
    }
    ```
5. Run `azd provision` again. The HTTPS listener, redirect rule, and NSG allow rule are now in place.
6. Validate end-to-end: `curl -v https://app.contoso.com/` should return the Container App's response; `curl -v http://app.contoso.com/` should redirect to HTTPS.

**Teardown:** run `azd down` to remove the entire deployment, or delete the gateway/PIP/WAF policy/NSG/UAI manually. As stated above, flipping `enabled` back to `false` and re-provisioning will **not** delete the resources due to ARM incremental deployment semantics.

**Outputs surfaced by `main.bicep`:**

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_ENABLED` | Whether the stack was effectively deployed (also requires `networkIsolation` + `deployContainerEnv` + non-empty `containerAppsList`). |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_PUBLIC_IP` | The gateway's public IPv4 address (point your DNS A record at this). |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_GATEWAY_RESOURCE_ID` | Application Gateway resource ID. |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_NSG_RESOURCE_ID` | NSG attached to the AGW subnet. |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_WAF_POLICY_RESOURCE_ID` | WAF policy resource ID (for adding custom rules outside the template). |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID` | Principal ID of the AGW UAI (use to grant access to external Key Vaults). |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_LIVE` | `true` only when both `sslCertSecretId` and `frontendHostName` are set (live mode). |

In addition, the landing zone now surfaces a small set of outputs that consumers (and this module) depend on: `APP_GATEWAY_SUBNET_RESOURCE_ID`, `VNET_RESOURCE_ID`, `KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`, `KEY_VAULT_NAME`, `LOG_ANALYTICS_RESOURCE_ID`, and `CONTAINER_APP_INTERNAL_FQDN`.
